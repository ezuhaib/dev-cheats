PROCS & LAMDA
add1 = proc {|i|i+1}
add1 = lambda { |i|i+1}
add1 = Proc.new {|i|i+1}
add1 = ->i{i+1}
add1 = ->{return "hello"}
add1.call(1)
&add1 : converts proc to block e.g
[1,2,3].collect(&add1)
def some_method(arg1,&block) converts block to lambda
Lambda allows use of 'return' while proc does not
Lambda enforces arguments requirement while proc does not

MODULE
Module = namespace/class grouping
Module cannot be initialized, has no "self"
Module can be included in as a whole in other classes

REQUIRE
To include another file as such so that it's content can be used
e.g you may call User.first only because that class was required by rails base
required files may also define methods
required file is only loaded once
to load multiple times use LOAD
files are loaded from $load_path
Used before opening class

INCLUDE
Must be used from within a class
The included module must be defined in any of the required files
Unlike require, only modules can be included, not any file
The module's methods are merged with the current class

EXTEND
The module's methods extend only as class methods

Sanitization
ActionController::Base.helpers.strip_tags(string)
ActionController::Base.helpers.strip_links(string)

Advanced
"string".classify.constantize
"string".demodulize
"string".deconstantize

NEW VS INITIALIZE
New is a class method, initialize is an instance method

SUPER
In case of subclass, when used in an instance method,
  it pulls the parent's code for that instance method.
