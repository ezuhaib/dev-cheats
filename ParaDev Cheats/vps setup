C. INSTALLATIONS
(Need sudo apt-get update first)
Ruby

In summary you have to create and start a cluster, create an appropriate user and password,
and create a database you'd be working with. Finally you'll be migrating data from a data dump
using various commands.

E. DEPLOYMENT
On Remote:
	Create the apps/psymic folder
	Install git and bundler
	add github repo fetch key (private) key,
	and test using ssh -vT git@github.com
	Create shared paths, if not using a mina setup task
	You may want to set RAILS_ENV and RACK_ENV env variables on server
Locally:
	Review your deploy.rb file
	Install mina and mina-unicorn
	mina setup
	mina deploy
On Remote:
	Configure and start unicorn
	Configure and start nginx

E. LATER STEPS
Add crontasks back
Add the backup gem
